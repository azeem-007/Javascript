Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.

Loops in JavaScript allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. They're essential for tasks that require repetition, like iterating over arrays, performing repetitive calculations, or even animating objects on a screen.

### Types of Loops

1. **`for` Loop**: Repeats a block of code a specified number of times.
2. **`while` Loop**: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
3. **`do...while` Loop**: Similar to the `while` loop, but it will execute at least once regardless of the condition.
4. **`for...in` Loop**: Iterates over the properties of an object.
5. **`for...of` Loop**: Iterates over the values of an iterable object (like arrays or strings).

### Syntax and Examples

#### 1. `for` Loop

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // Output: 0 1 2 3 4
}
```

#### 2. `while` Loop

```javascript
while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i); // Output: 0 1 2 3 4
    i++;
}
```

#### 3. `do...while` Loop

```javascript
do {
    // code block to be executed
} while (condition);
```

**Example:**
```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i); // Output: 0 1 2 3 4
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

#### 4. `for...in` Loop

```javascript
for (variable in object) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
let person = {fname: "John", lname: "Doe", age: 25};

for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
    // Output: fname: John lname: Doe age: 25
}
```

#### 5. `for...of` Loop

```javascript
for (variable of iterable) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];

for (let num of numbers) {
    console.log(num);
    // Output: 10 20 30 40
}
```

These loops are powerful tools that help you manage repetitive tasks in your JavaScript code efficiently. If you have more questions or need further examples, feel free to ask!
