Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.
Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for code readability and
maintainability. Here are several reasons why it's important:
1. Descriptive variable names make your code easier to read and understand. Developers
(including yourself) can quickly grasp the purpose of a variable without needing to analyze the code in detail.
2. Well-named variables reduce the chances of introducing bugs when modifying or
extending code. You're less likely to misunderstand the variable's role and make incorrect changes.
3. Descriptive variable names serve as a form of self-documentation. They convey the intent
and context of the variable, reducing the need for additional comments.
4. When working in teams, clear variable names facilitate communication among developers.
Team members can understand each other's code more easily, leading to more efficient collaboration.
5. Meaningful variable names help prevent errors caused by using the wrong variable or
making incorrect assumptions about variable values.

6. During code reviews, meaningful variable names make it easier for reviewers to provide
feedback and identify potential issues.
Example Demonstrating the Importance of Descriptive Variable Names:
Consider the following example, where two variables store the price and quantity of a product. One uses a
meaningful name (productPrice and productQuantity), while the other uses less descriptive names (a and b):

// Less Descriptive Variable Names
let a = 10; // Price of the product
let b = 5; // Quantity of the product
let total = a * b; // Calculate total cost
// More Descriptive Variable Names
let productPrice = 10; // Price of the product
let productQuantity = 5; // Quantity of the product
let totalPrice = productPrice * productQuantity; // Calculate total cost

In this example, the version with descriptive variable names (productPrice, productQuantity, and totalPrice) is
much more understandable. Anyone reading the code can quickly deduce that it calculates the total cost of a
product based on its price and quantity. The version with less descriptive names (a, b, and total) is cryptic and
requires additional mental effort to decipher. Choosing meaningful variable names greatly enhances code
readability and comprehension.
